**Front End:**
I honed my front end development skills with a strong foundation in HTML and CSS, creating well-structured and visually appealing web pages.

I developed expertise in NodeJS and Express for scalable server-side applications, and further refined my capabilities using NestJS for modular and efficient code architecture. My expertise extends to efficiently managing data with MongoDB and PostgreSQL.
